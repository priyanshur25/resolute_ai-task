# resolute_ai-task
3 task based on machine learning and their deployment through streamlit library


Task 1:Use any clustering technique to extract patterns or segregate data into groups.
User Story: User should be able to provide a data point (a row) and program should be able to identify
to which cluster given data point belongs to and why?


Task 2: Train any classification model(s) on the train sheet and test your algorithm on the test sheet.
Share target values for the test, we will evaluate from our end.
If using multiple algorithms, plz share target values for each algorithm.
Also share your algorithmâ€™s train accuracy


Task 3: Use rawdata as input and derive
1. Datewise total duration for each inside and outside.
2. Datewise number of picking and placing activity done.
